CLaCUBooNC, CLUBooNC, CLUNC !
     which stands for
Client for LaCie U-Boot NetConsole
      in other words
Client to connect on the NetConsole of the U-Boot which is customized by LaCie


How it works ?
------------

CLUNC is a shell script which needs 2 components:
    1) clunc-open which opens a session,
    2) netcat (also called nc) which uses the session.

First, clunc-open broadcasts a magic packet (LUMP) in a loop.
When U-Boot receives a packet, it switches to the NetConsole mode.
A prompt is sent to clunc-open which stops sending LUMP.
It is now possible to send commands and receive answers via UDP.
Netcat is used to communicate with the NetConsole of U-Boot.

The network interface of the NAS must have an IP address which
is correctly routed on your network.
This address must be set via the LUMP with the option "-i".

The first LaCie NAS which is booting will be stopped by the LUMP.
It is possible to target a NAS by its MAC address with the option "-m".
Some NAS (or U-Boot versions) doesn't support this feature.


How to install ?
--------------

Download CLUNC with :
    git clone git://lacie-nas.org/clunc.git

It includes a shell script named clunc which needs 2 components:
    1) clunc-open is built by typing make.
    2) netcat should be provided by your distribution.

If you want to move the script, you must move the tool clunc-open
     in the same tree
  or in a directory pointed by PATH.


How to use it ?
-------------

CLUNC must be launched before switching on the NAS.
It will wait until U-Boot is ready.

If an U-Boot is already in NetConsole mode, the session will be resumed.
Before resuming a session, CLUNC sends a break character (Ctrl+C) to U-Boot.
If a command was running, the break will abort it.

It can be used
     as an interactive shell
  or to send a batch of commands via the standard input

In case of batch commands, CLUNC will close itself after a inactivity time.
This timeout can be defined with option "-w". The default is 1 second.

Examples:
    clunc -i 192.168.42.3
    clunc -i 192.168.42.3 < uboot-commands
    echo print | clunc -i 192.168.42.3


What to do when connected ?
-------------------------

U-Boot waits commands.
'help' prints available commands.
'print' prints environment variables.

The variables 'ipaddr' and 'serverip' are automatically set to IP addresses of
NAS and machine running clunc, respectively.

A Linux image can be downloaded via TFTP:
    tftp 0x800000 uImage
Launch it with command 'bootm'


How to see Linux messages ?
-------------------------

Linux can log its messages via netconsole if compiled with option CONFIG_NETCONSOLE.
This feature must be configured at boot time:
    set bootargs netconsole=6666@${ipaddr}/,6666@${serverip}/


Why my vanilla kernel doesn't boot ?
----------------------------------

The bootloader is configured to boot LaCie kernels.

In order to boot a standard kernel, 2 variables must be set:
    set mainlineLinux yes
    set arcNumber xxxx
    save
    reset
The variable 'arcNumber' must match the official mach ID of your board.
It can be found at:

To restore U-Boot for LaCie normal boot:
    set mainlineLinux no
    save
    reset
